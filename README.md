# SmallDrop
SmallDrop is a project being developed during my master thesis in medical robotics. It consists on a bioprinting system for *in situ* printing directly on burn wounds.

The main system is composed of three sub-systems:

- A 7 DOF robotic arm, named Panda from Franka Emika.
- A D415 Intel RealSense Depth camera.
- A custom print head based on a DIY syringe pump model.

The whole project is ROS-based and is being developed using ROS Melodic on a Linux Mint 19.2 64-bit. It has a simulation component based on the Gazebo simulator, and it also runs on the real robot. The robot is controlled via custom controllers.
